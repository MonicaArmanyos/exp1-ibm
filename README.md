# exp1-ibm
A quantum project using python and qiskit to get the reed muller polarities of algebraic Boolean functions and generating their corresponding circuits then calculate number of gates and cost of each circuit and running each circuit on ibmqx2, ibmq_vigo, ibmq_ourense, ibmq_santigo, ibmq_valencia, and ibmq_athens and calculating the size of their transpiled circuits and deciding which is the best architecture for each polarity and deciding which is the best polarity for each function in Reed Muller and on IBMQ architectures and drawing best polarity circuit for Reed Muller, and best polarity with best architecture transpiled circuit, also drawing graphs to show if the behavior in Reed Muller and IBM architectures are corresponding.
